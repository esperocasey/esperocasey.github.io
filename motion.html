        My animation was planned out as a Halloween e-card, since I was using the existing character from the vector assignment. In addition to this character, I drew a bat in illustrator, plus a spiral to apply rotation to for the background, and cartoon-y clouds for which I utilized frame-by-frame animation instead of motion tweens, since my vision was for these clouds to sway back and forth in a somewhat irregular fashion. I now have a thorough appreciation for how time-consuming it is to create animation.
