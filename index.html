    My name is Casey Des Rosier. I'm working towards a degree in illustration, & took VMD 105 as a way to begin familiarizing myself with the digital tools currently available. My design process has been completely 'analog' up to now; I've been working diligently towards mastery of drawing & painting. I had very minimal exposure to any of the programs we've discussed in this class, so it's been a very great learning experience for me. I am old enough to have been a MySpace & LiveJournal user "back in the day," so I've used HTML/CSS before.
