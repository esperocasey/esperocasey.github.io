        For my vector assignment, we were getting close to Halloween (my favorite holiday) so I decided to draw a spooky character/scene which could be used as a party invitation or perhaps a band flyer for a Halloween show. I definitely ran into a time crunch with this one, but it was still fun to work with illustrator and I learned a lot from this assignment. One main lesson I learned was to budget more time for selecting the right font!
