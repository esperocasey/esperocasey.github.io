        My goal for the raster assignment was to create a simple visual banner featuring my name. I used a photo I'd taken from the Bay Bridge as the background and a photo of my face over the sky which I attempted to blend into the fog. I decided to improve the relatively new SF skyline with a little picture of my cat. I chose a font which was bold but decreased the opacity to tie in with the transparency of the border I created. All in all I acheived my goal which was to design something simple and appropriate for my skill level with Photoshop, but also cohesive and interesting to look at.
